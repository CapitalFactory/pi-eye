<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could find out about your local environment from your phone like you use Google Maps to navigate?  We think so.</p>

<p>We are going to use the new camera module on the Raspberry PI to do things like determine if a shared room is in use but that's just a start.  Because we have such a rich data feed (over motion detectors), we can do a lot more.  We'll do things like detect if someone is leaving dishes in the sink... and then set off the fire alarm.</p>

<p>The system has three layers:</p>

<pre><code>1. Raspberry PI captures that pushes changes out to Amazon S3
2. An image classification process running on Amazon EC2
3. A simple page for viewing the current status (and history)
</code></pre>

<p>We could have served this application entirely from the PI but using the cloud simplifies the design and allows us to do things that are too compute-intensive for the ARM cpu.  By pushing data to the cloud, we don't have to worry about security and firewall issues.</p>

<p>The complication is that we need to minimize bandwidth consumption.  Thus, we use a differential image data feed rather than transmitting full images.</p>

<p>Once we have some real world data, we'll sort out how to minimize state transitions and resource consumption.</p>

<p>Will people let us point cameras at them all the time?  Will we creep people out?  We don't know.</p>

<p>Part of the decision to provide an open source / transparent implementation is to show that the system isn't really suitable for spying on people.</p>
