We think so.\r\n\r\nWe are going to use the new camera module on the Raspberry PI to do things like determine if a shared room is in use but that's just a start.  Because we have such a rich data feed (over motion detectors), we can do a lot more.  We'll do things like detect if someone is leaving dishes in the sink... and then set off the fire alarm.\r\n\r\nThe system has three layers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Raspberry PI captures that pushes changes out to Amazon S3\r\n2. An image classification process running on Amazon EC2\r\n3. A simple page for viewing the current status (and history)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Design Considerations\r\nWe could have served this application entirely from the PI but using the cloud simplifies the design and allows us to do things that are too compute-intensive for the ARM cpu.  By pushing data to the cloud, we don't have to worry about security and firewall issues.\r\n\r\nThe complication is that we need to minimize bandwidth consumption.  Thus, we use a differential image data feed rather than transmitting full images.\r\n\r\nOnce we have some real world data, we'll sort out how to minimize state transitions and resource consumption.\r\n\r\n### Social Considerations\r\nWill people let us point cameras at them all the time?  Will we creep people out?  We don't know.\r\n\r\nPart of the decision to provide an open source / transparent implementation is to show that the system isn't really suitable for spying on people.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is put together and sponsored by @joshuaellinger from Exemplar Technologies.\r\n\r\nChris Brown and Connor Smith are doing most/all of the coding.\r\n\r\n",
