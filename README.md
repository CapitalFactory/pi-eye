Raspberry PI-based camera-based instrumentation

Initially, we are building a service that detects when a conference room is in use at the Capital Factory and makes that information available to members.  Because we are using images instead of motion detectors, we can do a lot more interesting things in the future.

Development starts 1/13/14.

Initial Team:
  Joshua Ellinger (CTO/Exemplar Technologies)
  Chris Brown (UT Grad Student)
  Connor Smith (UT CS Student)
